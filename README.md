Your game path probably contains special characters, rename it and try again
```
### When i try to set the game path it shows "Cannot start process because a file name has not been provided" or just opens a folder
```
You clicked on "Open" at Soulworker tab on settings, to change the game path go to Custom client tab
```
### When i click on force patch or play button it shows a "Codepage Fix" error
```
You enabled the option to patch the .exe to support unicode languages, this is no longer needed on current clients so don't use it
